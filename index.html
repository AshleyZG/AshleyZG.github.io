        <p>I am a <span id="grade"></span> year PhD student at <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">UMSI</a>, advised by <a href="https://from.so/Steve_Oney">Steve Oney</a>. I completed my B.S. at <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a> in 2021.</p>
        <p id="research-interest">Scaling programming education has become a significant challenge due to the diverse backgrounds of students and limited instructional resources. Programming education generates numerous data sources, such as student code submissions and interaction logs. How can we best use these data sources to improve learning and instruction at scale? My research aims to address this question by designing and developing interactive systems that support learning and instruction at scale in programming education, facilitating the understanding of complex data sources. Currently, I focus on making code understandable at scale to benefit both instructors and students. I design and develop interactive systems that help instructors comprehend large and complex collections of student code in meaningful ways. Additionally, I explore methods to support students in following programming tutorials and engaging in programming courses. My research incorporates techniques from Human-Computer Interaction, Visualization, and Machine Learning.</p>
