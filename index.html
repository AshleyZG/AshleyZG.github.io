        <p><b>I'm actively looking for PhD positions!</b></p>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a senior undergraduate student at the EECS school of <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>. I am currently working remotely with <a href="http://www.timalthoff.com">Prof. Tim Althoff</a> and <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz/">Prof. Amy Zhang</a>. Last fall, I was a visiting student at the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu">Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering</a> at The University of Washington.</p>

        <h1>Research Interests</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Human-AI Interaction</li>
          <li>Data Science</li>
          <li>Scientific Reproducibility</li>

          I am broadly interested in studying <b>the gap between human behavior and computer</b>. Today, as computers become more and more integrated into our daily life, it is important to figure out a way to bridge this gap. I design, build, and study tools to help machines to handle and interpret the complexibility in human behaviors, while applying techniques from <b>Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Human-Computer Interaction</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am particularlly interested in studying <b>data scientist behaviors</b>. With an exponential increase in available data and a growing culture of "data-driven discovery", analysis tools have enjoyed widespread innovation and adoption. However, robust processes to guide the use of these systems remain in relatively short supply. My work is related to the following problems that data scientists typically encounter when programming:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Reproducibility</b>. As data analysis is highly iterative and exploratory, there are many different paths to consider in parallel during analysis. Where to make alternative analysis decisions and what the alternatives could look like are considered part of the analysis process. However, these parallel paths are not always well reflected in data science practice. To support more robust data science, we need tools that enable multiverse authoring.</li>
            <li><b>Collaboration</b>. Current linear layout in Jupyter Notebooks impedes with collaboration between data scientists. It requires a lot of navigation, memory and comparison to understand notebooks for data scientists and collaborators. Besides, editing could easily break the flow in the original notebook and cause interference with other collaborators' work. We need tools that support both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration.</li>

            Large scale analysis of source code, and in particular scientific source code, holds the promise of better understanding the data science process, identifying analytical best practices, and providing insights to the builders of scientific toolkits. However, large corpora have remained unanalyzed in depth, as descriptive labels are absent and require expert domain knowledge to generate. We propose a novel weakly supervised transformer-based architecture for computing joint representations of code from both abstract syntax trees and surrounding natural language comments. Our model enables us to examine a set of 118,000 Jupyter Notebooks to uncover common data analysis patterns. Focusing on notebooks with relationships to academic articles, we conduct the largest ever study of scientific code and find that notebook composition correlates with the citation count of corresponding papers.
